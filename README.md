# How it works
Goes through the selected .xlsx excel file, gathers all the relevent data, sorts each item in call number order, and then places the sorted rows onto a new csv file.

If there is an issue with a specific entry there are the error_log and debug_log files to help debug issues with the application. 
## Error_log
Error_log will print out different errors that might have occurred while trying to sort different rows for the new CSV file.

## Debug_log
Contains all the entries and how they are sorted to be placed onto the new CSV file.

## Note
Never delete the original sheet you are sorting. Data can be lost when sorting the data onto the new CSV file so keeping the original sheet is a must to retain potentially lost data.

# Documentation
Documentation of version changes, step by step guides, and contact information is provided within the PDF file documentation both in the repository and the zip file containing the executable.
